# students_dropout

##Description

The human resources department of your university just got funding for a "No student left behind" program. They ask your research department to help identify the students most likely to dropout so they can reach out and provide mentorship.

As part of your preliminary research, you come across a recent paper whose dataset seems to match the data at your disposal. You decide to replicate, compare and maybe improve their study:

M. V. Martins, D. Tolledo, J. Machado, L. M. T. Baptista, V. Realinho. (2021) "Early prediction of studentâ€™s performance in higher education: a case study" Trends and Applications in Information Systems and Technologies, vol.1, in Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing series. Springer. DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-72657-7_16 (incomplete paper here)
